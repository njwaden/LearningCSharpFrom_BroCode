# C# Learning Projects

Welcome! 👋 This repository contains a collection of C# projects created while following a YouTube tutorial series. Each project explores a different topic or concept in C#, organized under a single Visual Studio solution for easy access and learning.

## 📚 Learning Source

I'm currently learning C# through the following YouTube playlist:

▶️ [C# Tutorial for Beginners (YouTube Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOPNy28FDBys3GVP2LiaIyP_)

Big thanks to the creator of this playlist (Bro Code) for making such helpful content!

## 🧠 Project Structure

Each folder in the solution represents a different topic covered in the playlist. Some examples:

- `01_HelloWorld` – tutorial for beginners
- `02_Output` – output
- `03_Variables` – variables
- `04_Constants_π` – constantsπ
- `...` – More to come as the learning continues!

> All projects are part of a single `.sln` file and can be opened together in Visual Studio.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the projects:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.sln` file in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
3. Build and run any project individually.

## 🧩 Notes

- This repository is for personal learning and experimentation.
- Code is kept simple and focused on understanding the basics.
